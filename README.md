- I am a student in a Software Development bootcamp at Codespace ZA and will be getting a certificate in December 2022.

- I'm really excited to be learning how to code and different coding languages. After starting a web development course on Coursera, I decided to move to Codespace where I could learn in a more structured environment and more languages. 
- Outside the world of tech I really like to crochet and design clothing, I will occasionally draw something that isn't clothing but I prefer to draw outfits.
- I like watching stand-up comedy and listening to finance podcasts but the books I read are more often than not historical fiction or self-help.
